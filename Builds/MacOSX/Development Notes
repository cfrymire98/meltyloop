Dev. Process:

1. Add parameters, learn about how to implement a discrete GUI element for the bars or change the parameter type
Solved: ProcessorValueTree and boolean parameters for each of the bar values I would like to give the user

example: https://github.com/ffAudio/ffTapeDelay

2. Research the pros/cons of using the JUCE audiobuffer object vs a delay line for storing the replay data (or just an array)

3. Convert bars to samps by accessing the tempo from DAW

4. Figure out how to play from the buffer at half speed and/or pitched down at half the speed

5. Design an algorithm for calculating the fade gain at each replay sample with reference to the length of the buffer

6. GUI



Bonus Goals Given Time:

1. Add a speed parameter for the wet signal

2. Rename the source files to make it more personalized


Random Notes:

Make sure that if all bar length params are set to false that there is a default set in the process block

Worst Case:

Give the user no parameters besides wet dry and do a set bar length to guarantee some functionality for the presentation
