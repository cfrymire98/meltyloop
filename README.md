# Melty Loop:

## A time-based audio plugin by Conor Frymire

### Features:

-**Loop Duration**

Specifies (in measures) how much audio to actively save and replay

-**Pitch Shift Amount**

Specifies the replay speed of the looped audio. Intuitively, slower speed creates lower pitch.

-**Fade In/Out** 

Use this parameter to shape the envelope of the loop. Combining fade values
with loops that don't modify pitch allows you to emulate side chain compression

### Future:

In the future expect an override of styling for the GUI, 
use of state tree in the code to allow for preset creation,
and more control over the loop envelope.
